# A basic dev environment that I use for WHATEVER system

There is a script in here, README.sh, which will just look at your $HOME and let you know what it thinks you should do, what it thinks you should install. And prompt you to add things.

There is a [vim readme](VIMGUIDE.md).

## Bin Programs 

bin/ish: very useful wrapper for ssh if you work with lots of embedded devices under DHCP, always ssh'ing, IPs always changing.

bin/mtpmount: part of my on going war with media and mounting

bin/mtpumnt: same

bin/pasw: helps me control pulse audio a bit with my headset and headphones

bin/tirc: starts tmux + irssi with a different mouse mode than default for irssi's sake

gitstep: will allow you to look at commit on by one comparing HEAD to upstream
