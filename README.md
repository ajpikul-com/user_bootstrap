Just miscellaneous utilities and files

They should be symlinked to here so you can edit and update them easily

There is a script in here, README.sh, which will just look at your $HOME and let you know what it thinks you should do

bin/ish: very useful wrapper for ssh if you work with lots of embedded devices

bin/mtpmount: part of my on going war with media and mounting

bin/mtpumnt: same

bin/pasw: helps me control pulse audio a bit with my headset and headphones

bin/tirc: starts tmux + irssi with a different mouse mode than default for irssi's sake

.gitignore: basic .gitignore script for any project
